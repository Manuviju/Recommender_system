# Recommender_system
Project to make a movie recommendation system. 
We have tried to make two kind of recommendation system:
* **Content based filtering system.** This technique attempts to figure out what a user's favourite aspects of an item is, and then recommends items that present those aspects. In our case, we're going to try to figure out the input's favorite genres from the movies and ratings given.

* **Collaborative filtering system.** is also known as User-User Filtering. As hinted by its alternate name, this technique uses other users to recommend items to the input user. It attempts to find users that have similar preferences and opinions as the input and then recommends items that they have liked to the input.
